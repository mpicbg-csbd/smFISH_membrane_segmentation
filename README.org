** About

For information about the sample preparation and imaging involved in
creating the data please see [fn:1]

** Methods

Membrane pixelwise classification is performed with a 5-layer
(2-downsampling, 1-bottom, 2-upsampling) [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf][U-Net]] with same model used in
 [[https://github.com/orobix/retina-unet][retinal blood vessel segmentation]].

** Installation

You need Python >= 2.7 with the standard scientific python libraries: numpy, scipy, scikit-learn
 and scikit-image the deep learning framework Keras which uses as backend: Tensorflow or Theano

** Usage
